# install

Currently this library isn't available in npm because of its early stage. I don't
want to block the name for projects that may come up with a better solution.

So to install this library, just clone it in your node_modules folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/themasch/node-ebml.git node_modules/ebml
```

# state of this project

This project is in a very early stage. Parsing works (kind of) but its no where
near production ready.
